# Video Generator
From lab instructions:
## 4. Real-Time Images
- (a) Using the FPGA board, generate an artificial image of a square of a given radius, then output it onto the computer screen. Use board pins to adjust the radius of the circle.
- (b) Make the square move across the computer screen at a speed adjustable by the pins.
- (c) Make the square in (b) change its color in time, e.g., cyclically going through the rainbow colors and changing color each second.
